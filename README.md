# Customer List ETL
Basic demonstration of ETL process using the Panda's library in Python. 

# Scenario
The scenario in mind was a representative from the company reached out to the data engineering team to get a list of customers who needed to be called about changes to the company which effected them.

Unfortunately, the data was inconsistent and had some discrepancies. 

I, a senior data engineer of this comapny was tasked with cleaning the data and providing a easy to read, useable list which can be used to call the customers.

## Usage
1. Download/Clone the repository
2. Using VSCode, PyCharm, or any other Python editor, and setup your environment 
3. Using a package manager such as PIP, install the Panda's library
4. Run the program and compare the spreadsheets for yourself!
